The goal of this study is to explore the transcriptomic changes in
ovarian cancer cells by analyzing mRNA and lncRNA expression. We aim to
identify significantly dysregulated genes and understand their roles in
cancer progression using various computational techniques such as
volcano plots, bar graphs, PCA, and CNC (coding-non-coding) correlation
analysis.

1.  What are the differentially expressed genes in Ovarian Cancer?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}

```

Preparing the data for volcano plot

```{r}
mRNA_data <- read_csv("CNC_mRNA.csv")
mRNA_data <- mRNA_data |> 
  mutate(
    log2FC = ifelse(Regulation == "down", -log2(FoldChange), log2(FoldChange)),
    negLog10P = -log10(p_value),
    status = case_when(
      log2FC >= 1 & p_value < 0.05 ~ "Upregulated",
      log2FC <= -1 & p_value < 0.05 ~ "Downregulated",
      TRUE ~ "Not Significant"
    )
  )
```

```{r}
table(mRNA_data$status)
```

Plotting the Volcano plot for mRNA data

```{r}
ggplot(mRNA_data, aes(x = log2FC, y = negLog10P, color = status)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Upregulated" = "red",
    "Downregulated" = "green",
    "Not Significant" = "black"
  )) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 1), linetype = "dotted", color = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), linetype = "dotted", color = "grey40") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Volcano Plot: Differential Expression (mRNA)",
    x = "log2(Fold Change)",
    y = "-log10(p-value)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
lncRNA_data <- read_csv("CNC_lncRNA.csv")
lncRNA_data <- lncRNA_data |> 
  mutate(
    log2FC = ifelse(Regulation == "down", -log2(`FoldChange`), log2(`FoldChange`)),
    negLog10P = -log10(p_value),
    status = case_when(
      log2FC >= 1 & p_value < 0.05 ~ "Upregulated",
      log2FC <= -1 & p_value < 0.05 ~ "Downregulated",
      TRUE ~ "Not Significant"))
```

Preparing the data for volcano plot

```{r}
table(lncRNA_data$status)
```

Plotting the Volcano plot for lncRNA data

```{r}
ggplot(lncRNA_data, aes(x = log2FC, y = negLog10P, color = status)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Upregulated" = "red",
    "Downregulated" = "green",
    "Not Significant" = "black"
  )) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 1), linetype = "dotted", color = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), linetype = "dotted", color = "grey40") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Volcano Plot: Differential Expression (lncRNA)",
    x = "log2(Fold Change)",
    y = "-log10(p-value)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

What are the top twenty most upregulated and downregulated genes?

Compute log2FC and -log10(p-value)

```{r}

```

Top 20 upregulated genes

```{r}
top_up_mRNA <- mRNA_data |> arrange(desc(log2FC)) |> slice_head(n = 20)
```

Plot upregulated

```{r}
ggplot(top_up_mRNA, aes(x = reorder(GeneSymbol, log2FC), y = log2FC, fill = negLog10P)) + geom_col() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "darkred", name = "-log10(p-value)") + coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + labs( title = "Top 20 Upregulated Genes", x = "Gene Symbol", y = "log2(Fold Change)")
```

Top 20 downregulated genes

```{r}
top_down_mRNA <- mRNA_data %>% arrange(log2FC) %>% slice_head(n = 20)
```

Plot downregulated

```{r}
ggplot(top_down_mRNA, aes(x = reorder(GeneSymbol, log2FC), y = log2FC, fill = negLog10P)) + geom_col() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightgreen", high = "darkgreen", name = "-log10(p-value)") + coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Top 20 Downregulated Genes", x = "Gene Symbol", y = "log2(Fold Change)")
```

Is there any transcriptomic variation among the ovarian cancer samples
and control sample?

Which lncRNAs correlate with mRNAs in ovarian cancer?

Conclusion

By combining volcano plots, bar graphs, PCA, and CNC analysis, we can
dissect the complex transcriptomic landscape of ovarian cancer cells.
This structured pipeline not only identifies key regulators but also
provides biological insights for downstream validation and hypothesis
generation.
